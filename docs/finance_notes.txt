Finance Basics:
- Interest is the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage.
- Compound interest grows faster than simple interest because it earns interest on both the principal and accumulated interest.
- A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home, typically paid over 15 to 30 years.

Investment Basics:
- Stocks represent ownership in a company.
- Bonds are debt instruments where investors lend money to governments or corporations.
- Diversification helps reduce risk in investment portfolios.
