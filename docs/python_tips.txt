Python Development Tips:
- List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists.
- The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in CPython prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes in parallel.
- Use virtual environments (venv or conda) to isolate dependencies.
- Asyncio is used for writing concurrent code using async/await syntax.

Example:
squares = [x*x for x in range(10)]
